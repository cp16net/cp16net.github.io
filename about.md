I am a Software Engineer at heart that has a passion for learning and applying new technology.

I have a background in cloud infrastructure, database integration, and open source development.
I sparked an interest in Openstack and has been involved for about 5 years on various
projects in the ecosystem but mainly focused on Trove.

I have built cloud APIs in many different languages including Java, Python, and Golang.

I am a geek and enjoy playing video games and reading up on technology trends.
